# Project Description
This project evaluates and enhances ten different AI predictive models, encompassing both machine learning and deep learning models, which are either well-established or cutting-edge techniques. 
We employ a dual evaluation approach, utilising both k-fold cross-validation and holdout methods. Moreover, we explore the importance of feature selection using the ubiquitous Lasso for dimensionality reduction to improve model efficiency. Our assessment includes:

## Machine Learning Models
- **k-Nearest Neighbors (kNNs)**
- **Support Vector Machines (SVMs)**
- **Decision Trees (DTs)**
- **Linear Regression**
- **Logistic Regression**
- **Random Forest**
- **Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost)**

## Deep Learning Architectures
- **Feed-Forward Fully Connected Neural Network (FFNN)**
- **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)**
- **Gradient-Boosted Neural Networks (GBNNs)**
For the GBNN model, we utilized a package available at the following link: [https://github.com/GAA-UAM/GBNN].
